# MC Ultimate Downloader

## What is this?
This utility automatically updates installed mods, resource packs, and data packs for new versions of Minecraft. It's designed for those who want to upgrade to the latest version of the game without wasting time manually searching for and replacing each add-on.

## How to correctly fill out mods_list.txt, dp_list.txt (data packs) and rp_list.txt (resource packs) files?
To fill in these text files correctly, you need to write the names of mods/resource packs/datapacks separately on a new line. To speed up this process, you can use my other utility, File Analyzer.

*to do this, it is best to create a separate folder and drag the executable file there.*

Enjoy!
